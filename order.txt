This is the proper chronological order of the icons, according to when
I initially created the icon. Some of the older icons were restored
from my memory, and I also added the enhancement of them being an icon
file, which some of them were originally not. Therefore, those icons
are not identical in binary form to the original older form.

Here is an ordering of icons based off of their quality.  The
progression mostly goes from best to worst, except when there are
icons that are of even quality.

Best to worst:
Rubiks.ico
startupmgr.ico
palscrn.ico
info.ico
phantominfo.ico
MhkEdit.ico
Andrew.ico
fasthelp.ico
mainico.ico
dlgedit.ico
Simp.ico
prisonman.ico
titactoe.ico
restaurant.ico
Organizer.ico

sndstud.ico
madlibs.ico

What are some qualities that the best icons had?

* Representation of a single object.

* Excelent color control.

* Unique object outline or distinguishing internal details.

* Three-dimensional look.

* The representative object didn't have too many busy details.

What are some qualities that the worst icons had?

* Full square border.

* Words in the icon.

* Abstract, non-representative picture.

* More than one object in the icon.

* Too many details, too busy of an icon.

* Inefficient usage of available drawing space.

Note that color quality was not one of the cited reasons for a poor
icon.  This is because color styles largely have to do with the
capabilities of the available technology rather than the artistic
abilities.  However, icons designed for modern applications should
have a modern look, and if this rule is not withheld, then that will
count against an icon's quality.

Hey, now I improved my Sound Studio icon.  Guess what will happen when
I rerank my icons?

Some important observations:

* Obviously the ordering is not identical to my previous ordering for
  the unchanged icons, but it is similar.

* I think the large amounts of black and color choice on Palette
  Screener makes for a worse icon than it could be, even with the low
  color confinements.

* By adding a carefully styled borderline with attention to detail for
  my Sound Studio icon, along with changing the colors to match nicer,
  I was able to bring Sound Studio from being the worst icon all the
  way to being the best.  Very few modifications, but dramatic effects
  on perceived quality.
